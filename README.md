# A short introduction for this project

## Why develop this project?
- Improve my website building ability and familiarize with webgis related API
- As a very basical base for my graduate design 
- As an answer for an assessment(Individual Visualisation of CASA0003 Mini Project)

## What the visualisation is aiming to show?
This project is aiming to provide a platform for students who will study in London in the future, 
which helps them get some information about London, in terms of transport net, commute time, housing price and so forth, 
helping them make a final choice for where they live.

## Outline the design and technical approach taken
### Outline the design
This project is a long-scroll website featuring a fixed-top navigation bar. The homepage displays a classic London photograph 
with a prominently highlighted fullscreen button. The main content is divided into sections using the `<section>` tag, with map 
and icon code separated from the main page and embedded via iframes.

To enhance overall interactivity, the project leverages the Bootstrap library. Additionally, all Mapbox maps in this project 
are enriched with extensive interactive featuresâ€”inviting you to explore.

### Technical approach taken
- HTML5 & CSS3: Basic webpage structure and styling.
- JavaScript: Dynamic interactivity and data processing.
- Mapbox: Mapping library for interactive maps.
- ECharts: Data visualization library.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive design.
- Turf.js: Geospatial analysis library for processing and analyzing spatial data.
